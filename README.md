# Classic & Modern Cryptographic Ciphers üîê

A compact collection of classical and modern cryptographic algorithms implemented in **Python**. This repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and understanding how traditional and widely-used encryption techniques work under the hood.

## üß† What‚Äôs Included

### üî∏ Classical Ciphers
These are historic encryption algorithms used before the advent of modern cryptography:
- **Caesar Cipher** ‚Äì Simple substitution using character shifts
- **Playfair Cipher** ‚Äì Bigram substitution based on a 5x5 key matrix
- **Rail Fence Cipher** ‚Äì Zigzag transposition cipher

### üîπ Modern Ciphers
These represent the foundational concepts of modern-day encryption:
- **RSA Cipher** ‚Äì Asymmetric encryption using large prime numbers
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)** ‚Äì Symmetric key block cipher (now deprecated)
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** ‚Äì Industry-standard secure encryption

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Most algorithms use only standard Python libraries. For AES and DES, you may need:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
